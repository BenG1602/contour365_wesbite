<h4>5-18
OCTOBER 2018 </h4>
    <p>
A free public art event over three weeks presenting artworks and performances by 60 artists in the world famous public realm and national cultural icons around Lake Burley Griffin, Canberra. contour is unique in the field of public sculpture and performance events as it takes place in a consciously designed and culturally layered landscape, in one of only three designed capital cities.


The festival site is a place with deep cultural and heritage overlays. All artworks and performances are site specific, drawing inspiration from or reflecting on the cultural or physical character of Canberra. The sense of place of the Canberra lakeside landscape resonates with the artworks and performances. The connections to Canberra’s history provoke a variety of responses from the public that embed a memory of place. The event reinforces the beauty of the designed landscape, and recognises landscapes hidden from view through design.  It presents stories of Australia political, cultural and physical history. It includes stories from all Australians, from our past and our future.

  <h5>ABOUT THE WORK <br>
A series of fortunate events. With the help of many I was able to take an installation of my work to New York in 2017. As a dutiful servant of the demands of cultural experience I journeyed to the institutions known to hold the valuable artefacts of our time. I came back with treasure on my telephone that also doubles as a visual recording device. Like Zizeks imbecile I accepted the language of our creative time but contrary and as a result of my excess…or was it lack, I also sort to take that swipe at the elephant.  </h5>

    <div class="part2"><img src="Images/2018_4.jpeg" alt="Avatar">
  <h5>ABOUT THE WORK <br>
‘when you fall softly' explores ideas of death and departure through the still life genre. The work is an extension of my practice and explores the idea of creating memorials for passing moments, especially the interactions and relationships between humans and animals in shared urban areas such as city parks and green spaces. Based on a response to the fishing activities and wildlife of Lake Burley Griffin, this work features a taxidermy Australian black swan (Cygnus Atratus) as a focal point, set amongst a still-life spread with red grapes and flushed pomegranates.</h5>
