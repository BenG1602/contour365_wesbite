  <h3>Contour556 returns for The 4th edition this October -
    bigger and better than before. </h3>
  <p>
    The 2022 edition sees the festival rebranded as Canberra Art Biennial, and sees expansion to the National Arboretum (contour 656), the University of Canberra (contour 606) as well as maintaining and building further on our presence in North and South Canberra, centred on contour 556, the height above sea level of Lake Burley Griffin.
    Canberra Art Biennial extends across Canberra’s public spaces, and we are excited to partner with more private and public gallery / cultural spaces in inner north and south Canberra.

    Neil Hobbs is the creative director for the contour 556 and contour 656 areas, with support from Heeseon Jung and the contour 556 board. The contour 606 satellite event will be co-curated by University of Canberra staff members Associate Professor Julian Raxworthy, discipline lead of the landscape architecture program and Ben Ennis-Butler, senior lecturer and Program Core Coordinator, Design.
    University of Canberra joins us as a major sponsor and supporter - The Faculty of Arts and Design students have revisited our logo and graphic branding, and we are delighted to have Julian and Ben contribute to the event.

    Artists will be responding to the designed city of Canberra: represented by Australia’s political, cultural and physical history. The event engages people of all ages and abilities, delighting, puzzling and encouraging interaction with art and public space.
    The 2022 event is supported by sponsorship from the University of Canberra, Bonhams, KDN Group, Keir Foundation, numerous individual supporters through our crowdfunding pitches and the ACT Government.

    We thank in-kind supporters National Arboretum Canberra, Able Landscaping, Cox Gallery, Beaver Galleries, Front Gallery, Thor’s Hammer Mixing Room Gallery, Barton Art Box, ANU School of Art and Design, Craft ACT, Canberra Museum and Gallery, Manning Clark House, Verity Lane Market

    contour 556 acknowledges the Ngunnawal people, the traditional custodians of the land on which we live, work, rest and play.
