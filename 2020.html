    <div class="part2"><img src="Images/2020_3.png" alt="Avatar">
  <h5>ABOUT THE WORK <br>
Lurk Burley Griffin engages with the lake and its surrounds as a site of mystery, fecundity, threat and transformation. A trail of short video works by Anderson, Florance, Malins and Smith feature poetry, visuals and soundscapes exploring what waits beneath the surface and lingers at the edge, both literally and metaphorically. Come and loiter. Dip your toes in or immerse yourself – it is up to you. </h5>

I can’t run away all my life sometimes I just have to stand and fight, - 
2020</p> 
    <div class="part2"><img src="Images/2020_4.jpeg" alt="Avatar">
  <h5>ABOUT THE WORK <br>
It’s a readymade canvas both epic and contained. An Australian flag, clearly a little worse for wear. It’s huge - large enough to have once flown above Parliament House in Canberra, the very epicentre of the political nation. This gives it its own public life, a singular object’s history that is also wrapped up in the history of our federated, young nation. Expansive in scale, this object also provides a conceptual boundary, a historical and political framing that lends symbolic weight to Richard Lewer’s intervention.</h5>
