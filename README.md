This website is a idea on concept of exploring diffrent ways data, text and images can be presented in a effective way to capture the audience. By using percentages and flexable values the wesbite is responsive to all devices including mobile, tablet and computer. I think my ideas and thoughts i had worked well but transfering them into html let me down. Most of the ideas i had required alot more knowledge of html and css but also include javascript which i have limited expirence in. After a change in plan i limited the website to only html and css. This kept things simple without overcomplicating anything and make the wesbite more cosistant and functional 




reflect on your project: recognise the things you did well and the things that you could have possibly improved.

include your low-fi prototypes and discuss how they were/were not implemented.

provide a briefly annotated list of resources that you found helpful while creating the website. 

In the reflection, you might describe the reasons for any design decisions you made, or discuss a description of the challenges you encountered and how you solved them. It is your chance to reflect on the project and consider what you learnt or what would you would do differently.
